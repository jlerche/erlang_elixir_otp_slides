Erlang, Elixir, BEAM, OTP, and Phoenix

# Introduction
* Erlang is a functional programming language
* Developed in the 1980s at Ericsson for telecom applications
* First commercial project launched in 1994
* AXD301 switch with 1.7 million lines of Erlang code
  - Reported 99.9999999% availability (~31 ms downtime per year)
---
#### Telephony requirements for Erlang
* Telecom applications are highly concurrent by nature
  - A single switch handles 10s to 100s of thousands of simultaneous transactions
* Switching networks are distributed
* Must have as close to 100% uptime as possible
  - Can't crash without automatic recovery
  - Software must be changeable on the fly
  - A network must be able to tolerate failure of individual switches
* Soft real-time guarantees
---
#### High level implementation
* Model as finite state machines that undergo state transitions in response to protocol messages
* An FSM is a lightweight process in memory
* Most processes waiting until event triggers state transition
* Upon receipt, execute small amount of code
  - Change state
  - Send message
  - Wait for next event
* One process should not be able to crash the system, or affect other processes
---
#### Who uses Erlang?
* WhatsApp (2 million connections on a single node)
* Facebook chat backend
* Amazon SimpleDB
* Discord
* League of Legends
---
#### BEAM Architecture
* Schedulers
* Processes
* Distribution
---
#### BEAM: Schedulers
* BEAM has a thread per logical core
* 1 thread = 1 scheduler
* Periodically (20-40k reductions) a master scheduler is chosen
  - Does internal load balancing to utilize all cores efficiently
---
#### BEAM: Schedulers
* A scheduler is a set of 3/4 priority queues
  - Max , high, normal, low
* Queues are implemented as work stealing deques
* An executing process runs for 2k reductions before being rescheduled
  - 2k reductions < ~1ms

#### BEAM: Processes

---
#### BEAM: Processes
* Completely isolated, independent unit of execution
* Have their own stack and heap
* Communicate via message passing
  - This means that data is copied when passed
---
# Processes are fully pre-emptive
* Two closest languages/frameworks are Go and Akka
  - Go can't pre-empt inside of loops
  - Akka uses a cooperative scheduler
---
#### Elixir: History
* First released in 2011
* Created by JosÃ© Valim who was heavily involved in the Ruby and Rails community
* Inspired by his difficulties making Rails more concurrent
* The language takes a strong inspiration from Ruby for syntax, and Lisp for structure
  - Syntax is not homoiconic on the surface
  - But elixir allows quoting and exposes its AST for macros
* Dynamically typed, functional language, immutable data structures
* Like JVM languages, can call Erlang libraries with no penalty
---
# Elixir Philosophy
Concurrent programming should not be difficult
---
#### Value types
* Integers
* Floats
* Atoms (constant whose name is its own value)
  - `:my_atom`
  - `true, false, nil` also atoms
* Ranges
  - `start..end`
* Regular expressions
  - `~r{regexp}`
---
#### Collection types
* Tuples
  - `{:ok, 42, "next"}`
* Linked lists
  - ```elixir
  list = [1,2,3,4]
  hd(list) # 1
  tl(list) # [2,3,4]```
* Binaries (strings are UTF-8 encoded binaries)
* Maps
  - `%{key => val, key => val}`
---
#### System types
* PIDs
  - Process ID, references local or remote process.
* Port
  - For interprocess communication with non-erlang systems
---
#### Anonymous functions
* AKA unnamed functions
* Can be passed as arguments (they're also a type)
* Parenthesis optional
```elixir
iex> add = fn (a, b) -> a + b end
Function<12.118419387/2 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
iex> add.(1,2)
3
```
---
#### Named functions
```elixir
defmodule MyModule do
  def say_hello(name) do
    IO.puts "Hello #{name}"
  end
end

iex> MyModule.say_hello("Joe")
Hello Joe
```
---
#### Pattern matching
* Instead of assigning a variable, think of as binding a variable
* `a = 1` doesn't mean we're assigning `1` to `a`
```elixir
iex> a = 1
1
iex> 1 = a
1
```
---
#### Pattern matching
```elixir
iex> [1, a, 3] = [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex> a
2
```
---
#### Pattern matching
Ignore values with `_`
```elixir
iex> [a, _, _] = [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
iex> a
1
```
